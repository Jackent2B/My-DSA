// ALGORITHM:
// STEP 1: Create Adjacency Matrix for the given graph.
// STEP 2: Replace all the diagonal elements with the degree of nodes. For eg. element at (1,1) position of adjacency matrix will be replaced by the degree of node 1, element at (2,2) position of adjacency matrix will be replaced by the degree of node 2, and so on.
// STEP 3: Replace all non-diagonal 1â€™s with -1.
// STEP 4: Delete any one row and any one column.
// STEP 5: Find Determinant, it will give the final answer.
